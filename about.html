        <p>
            I am music composer that wants to reincorporate the old traditions of composing.<br> I've been studying classical 
            composition, as well as modern composition and production<br> techniques.<br> I also have a deep interest in 
            finance and the way payments work in regards to<br> the music industry. I want to leverage blockchain and 
            DeFi technologies to improve the way<br> music institutions and regular musicians earn their income.
